1) 
```{}
used original blast order for map construction in R/qtl

code: test_blast_order.R

Result: pairwise rf and LOD score figure suggest wrong chromosome assignment, so blast order cannot
be used directly for map construction. 
```

2) 
```{}
filtered blast result using "reoder_blast_result.R"

Result: only few markers have chromosome assignment, so this result cannot be directly used for map construction  
```

3) 
```{}
drop markers with double crossover more than 10 

code: QTL_check_map_Ruijuan.R

Result: looks like better order within each chromosome but got map extension problem again.
```

4) 
```{}
switch marker order within each chromosome, use physical position on indiviudal ref (napus & rapa) chromosome

code: QTL_check_map_Ruijuan.R

Result: pairwise rf and LOD score figure suggest wrong order again. 
```

5) 
```{}
try R/onemap for map construction 

code: map_construction_onemap.R

Result: min LOD score of 6 & max rf of 0.25 gives result very similar to FnP's genetic map 
```
